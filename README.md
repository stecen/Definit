Development in Android Studio, targeting Nougat devices with support down to KitKat, opened a path to gain experience with Android support libraries and issues, floating windows, fragments, service and activity management, SQL, networking, Maven, Git, and UX and UI design. 

Design was a strong focus in this project -- I conducted user tested and carefully storyboarded on paper and with Adobe Illustrator. Making sure the app took Material Design and fleshed out its own identity was also something I was aiming for, with the inclusion of specific animations, and consistent color scheme.
